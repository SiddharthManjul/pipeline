# Credynx: The Underground Circuit of Web3

Credynx is a reputation-based talent marketplace designed to connect vetted Web3 developers with innovative founders. In an ecosystem where visual noise often drowns out technical merit, Credynx shifts the focus from **connections** to **contributions**.

## 🚀 Mission

Our mission is to build a seamless pipeline for the Web3 ecosystem where high-quality developers are discovered based on their actual output—code, projects, and peer validation—rather than social proximity.

## ✨ Core Features

### 🏆 Reputation-Based Ranking
- **Tier System**: Developers are ranked from Tier 4 (Entry) to Tier 1 (Elite) based on a multi-parameter scoring algorithm.
- **Data-Driven Metrics**: Scores are calculated using GitHub activity (30%), project complexity (25%), time investment (15%), hackathon wins (20%), and community validation (10%).

### 🔍 Discovery Directories
- **Developer Directory**: Search and filter developers by tier, stack, availability, and reputation.
- **Project Showcase**: A curated gallery of projects built within the ecosystem, complete with live demos and repository links.

### 🛡️ Tier-Based Vouching
- **Meritocratic Endorsements**: A hierarchical vouching system where higher-tier developers validate the skills of those in lower tiers.
- **Anti-Gaming**: Built-in limits and weights ensure vouches represent genuine technical endorsement.

### 🤝 Founder-Developer Matching
- **Smart Matching**: Founders receive data-backed developer recommendations based on job requirements and reputation scores.
- **Direct Engagement**: Integrated sessions for technical interviews, coffee chats, and community calls.
